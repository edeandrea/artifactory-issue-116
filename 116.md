You’ll have to download it and fill in a public repoKey, username, & password, as well as a resolve repository repoKey. Also a contextUrl that points to some artifactory location.

Simply run `gradlew artifactoryPublish` and it will fail with

```groovy

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':artifactoryPublish'.
> File '/home/edeandrea/Downloads/artifactory-issue-116/build/distributions/artifactory-issue-116-1.0-db.zip' does not exist, and need to be published from publication mainJava

At the end of the day though I’ve debugged this myself
 
In [org.jfrog.gradle.plugin.artifactory.task.helper.TaskHelperPublications](https://github.com/JFrogDev/build-info/blob/master/build-info-extractor-gradle/src/main/groovy/org/jfrog/gradle/plugin/artifactory/task/helper/TaskHelperPublications.java) in the method [private DeployDetails.Builder createBuilder(File file, String publicationName)](https://github.com/JFrogDev/build-info/blob/master/build-info-extractor-gradle/src/main/groovy/org/jfrog/gradle/plugin/artifactory/task/helper/TaskHelperPublications.java#L252)
 
[The first thing it does is](https://github.com/JFrogDev/build-info/blob/master/build-info-extractor-gradle/src/main/groovy/org/jfrog/gradle/plugin/artifactory/task/helper/TaskHelperPublications.java#L253)

```java 
if (!file.exists()) {
  throw new GradleException("File '" + file.getAbsolutePath() + "'" +
                    " does not exist, and need to be published from publication " + publicationName);
}
```
 
If the publication has reference to an artifact which doesn’t exist (because the task that produces it was skipped due to there not being any input to perform the task), then the publish fails. I would think that there should be cases where we should be able to say “include the output of this task in the publication if it exists”, which is the case I have here.
 
I am trying to build an enterprise-wide plugin which enforces certain conventions. If things exist in certain places in the source tree, then publish an artifact containing them. If not, don’t publish them.
